...apparently we've been shut out of
Security on the medical level. The Sarge
was _not_ impressed and one poor fool
got demoted to Private on the spot. The
elevator door is hooked up to a network
of security cameras (something about
enforcing quarantine after the
handy-flux plague of Beta-17). I reckon
if I knock enough of them out, the
feedback will cancel the lockdown on the
elevator door...
