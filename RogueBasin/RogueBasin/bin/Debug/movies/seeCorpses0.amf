The sight of the corpses on the ground. You knew these people, well at
least some of them. It was an ambush. Eight of you, being sent to the
border to sabotage a neighbouring power that was gearing for war. But
they must have got wind of it somehow and as you were about to make
camp twenty of them dropped from the mountainside. You fought as hard
as you could, but there were too many and the last thing you remember
is a blow to the back of your head, cold and the sensation of
drowning.
