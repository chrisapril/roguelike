You didn't take the advanced electronics
part of the Sergeant's exam (or any part
of it, in fact) but you're pretty sure
this here is an Interface
Demodulator. You once had to blow some
up as part of a mission. What do you
know about it? Oh, you can connect it to
things and they tend to blow up. Swings
and roundabouts, eh?
