                               SOLDIER!

LISTEN UP! This zone IS patrolled by enemy PATROL BOTS. They move
along FIXED ROUTES and LOOK DIRECTLY AHEAD. If you ARE as CLEVER as
YOU think you are, then you'll be able to SNEAK ATTACK them.

And if you value your skin, Soldier, or MORE IMPORTANTLY the skin of
your R. E. E. D. unit, then YOU will look out for any weaponry
scattered around the ship that might be of help.

GET TO IT!
