An explosion of light in your skull. You wrench open your eyes and
struggle to stay on your feet. Keep your eyes closed and you're
lost. You learned that fast. Everything's white. You hear laughing,
he's preparing for the final blow. Arrogance will be his undoing. With
your training you don't need to see. It's over in an instant, your
hands clasped around his neck, the laughter becoming a surprised yelp
as your fingers pierce his larynx. You reach down and take the crystal
he used - that stun was the worst you'd ever felt.
