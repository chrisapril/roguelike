                               SOLDIER!

LISTEN UP! This next ZONE is riddled with ROLLING BOMBS. Sound BAD?
YES, it IS. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT, let them come close.

As my OLD MOTHER used to say, the only GOOD DEAD ROLLING BOMB is the
ROLLING BOMB that is DEAD next to SOMEONE ELSE. I may be PARAPHRASING
slightly.

ONE MORE THING. Those EGG-HEADS in LOGISTICS have UPGRADED your
R. E. E. D. to INTERFACE with ENEMY TACTICAL control units that can be
SCAVENGED from the ship.

GET TO IT!
