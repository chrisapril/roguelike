                               SOLDIER!

LISTEN UP! This next ZONE is riddled with ROLLING BOMBS. Sound BAD?
YES, it IS. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT, let them come close.

As my OLD MOTHER used to say, the only GOOD DEAD ROLLING BOMB is the
ROLLING BOMB that is DEAD next to SOMEONE ELSE. I may be PARAPHRASING
slightly.

What are you STARING AT?

GET TO IT!
