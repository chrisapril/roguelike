The lich's treasure room lies before you! You hurry to gather up the
most powerful and valuable looking items. The luster of a black pearl
catches your eye. You touch and a bolt of energy runs up your arm,
wracks through your shoulders, up your neck and into your head. The
memories you've fought so hard to regain start swimming around your
head, being displaced, coming loose. In desperation you catch hold of
a fragment - sounds, smells - a battle near a stream on the
mountainside. The view becomes more vivid, more real and you know you
are beating the lich's trap... Suddenly, you're there.
