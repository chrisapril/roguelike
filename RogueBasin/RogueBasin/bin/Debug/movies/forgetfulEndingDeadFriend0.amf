They are dead. It looks like they crawled here after the battle and
bled to death. It appears to be a woman but you don't recognise
her. You quickly run through her pockets and take a few things of use.

Perhaps there's another cave around here where you could camp. Then
you have to figure out what to do next. You survived and get to live
to fight another day.
