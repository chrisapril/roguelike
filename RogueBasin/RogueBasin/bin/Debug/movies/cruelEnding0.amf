Yes, you remember her. You had a mild infatuation with her back in
your academy days. But that seems so long ago. Your time in the
dungeon taught you one thing - the strong prosper and the weak
perish. And you are one of the strong. You don't need the guild and
you don't need her.

You turn your back and walk out of the cave, ready to carve yourself
an empire in the unexpecting world.
