                               SOLDIER!

Soldier. I don't think ANYONE thought you'd get this far. We've been
trying to crack this Space Hulk for some time. If you destroy the
computer nodes in this zone, then that's it. No more defenses. It's
ours.

I heard that the boys in LOGISTICS have all stopped work and are
gathered around the sensor display.

Good luck, son. Just a little further.
