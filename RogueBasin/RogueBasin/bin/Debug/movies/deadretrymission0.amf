                               SOLDIER!

So SOLDIER. Do YOU think that we give you R. E. E. D. UNITS as your
PLAYTHINGS? Do you think that they are SO CHEAP THAT WE HAVE HUNDREDS
in our hanger bay? DO you think that it's all OK because you HAVEN'T
DONE THIS BEFORE?! That this is some sort of KINDERGARTEN for SOLDIERS
who ARE STILL IN THEIR DIAPERS?!

SOLDIER YOU ARE WRONG. Get your ASS into ANOTHER R. E. E. D. unit and
GO AND SORT OUT THE MESS YOU MADE.

*gasp*
