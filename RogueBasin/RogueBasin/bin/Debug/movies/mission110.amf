                               SOLDIER!

LISTEN UP! I just heard from the boys in LOGISTICS that you've been
WORKING your way through the ZONES in a PERFUNCTORY manner!

I might EVEN GO SO FAR as to say that SOME OF THEM were a LITTLE
impressed. Such a LITTLE bit impressed that they AGREED WITH ME that
you ought to have access to some replacement R. E. E. D. units.

Well, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? Get OUT THERE!
