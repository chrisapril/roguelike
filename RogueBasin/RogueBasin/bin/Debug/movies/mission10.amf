                               SOLDIER!

LISTEN UP! You may have NOTICED that that last ZONE WAS patrolled by
enemy PATROL BOTS. They move along FIXED ROUTES and LOOK DIRECTLY
AHEAD.

Well I've got some NEWS for YOU. This zone IS also patrolled by enemy
PATROL BOTS. But some CLEVER-ASS JACK has REPROGRAMMED them to move
around the deck. They still move along FIXED ROUTES and LOOK DIRECTLY
AHEAD. Think YOU can COPE with this Soldier?

GET TO IT!
