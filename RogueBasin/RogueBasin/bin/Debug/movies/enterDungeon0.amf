You stagger to your feet and look around you groggily. Where are you?
Who are you? You try to think back but all there is is blackness.

You feel your body - you're wet, dressed in a few torn strips of
cloth. How did you get here?

It's dark but you can pick out shapes moving in the distance. Best
keep moving.
