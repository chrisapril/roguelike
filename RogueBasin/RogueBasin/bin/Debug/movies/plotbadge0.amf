A training exercise, yes, but it's about the nearest thing sanctioned
as a sport here. Targets placed on either side of a long corridor and
you sprint down hitting targets on alternate walls, pushing yourself
off each wall for speed. It's just you and one other left. You're
wearing a badge someone gave you as a good luck charm. It's probably
cursed - you must be going soft. *bang* And you're off, sprinting, not
thinking, pushing off each wall, getting faster and faster...
