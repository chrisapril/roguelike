No matter how much time you spend unrolling old scrolls and getting
dust deeply embedded in your fingertips you don't seem to be able to
find anything worth reading in this goddamn place. The one or two
books taht looked interesting were so far above your head it was like
reading another language.

Perhaps you're brain's just reached its limit for now?
