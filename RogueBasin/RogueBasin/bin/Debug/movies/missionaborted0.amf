                               SOLDIER!

Did YOU think that this mission was in some way OPTIONAL? That YOU
would DECIDE if you FELT LIKE CARRYING OUT MY ORDERS? That I AM HERE
FOR YOUR PERSONAL AMUSEMENT AND NOT THE SAFETY OF OUR WHOLE GODDAMN
SPECIES!

NO? Well, fine. Go FIND YOURSELF. And when you're DONE WITH THAT. Send
your GODDAMN R. E. E. D. unit back in there and DO WHAT YOU'RE PAID TO
DO!

*gasp*
