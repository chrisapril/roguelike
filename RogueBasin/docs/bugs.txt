*** BUGS PRE 1.5

** Burst of speed
REPORTED: 14/06/10

Lasts too long and stacks!
Need a current special is on check.

** Monster SpeedDown effect
REPORTED: 14/06/10

Should use the new effect polling system. Need to check it works

*** STUFF TO CHECK

** Staircases

Currently we give the player a cheat move when they enter a
dungeon. Prob better to just make staircases take no time
(timeAdvances = false)

** Stamina can be above health

Really true? Old bug report

** SightRadiusUp/Down

Should this use the new effect structure? Or is it OK?

*** ENHANCEMENTS

** Time advancing for monsters

Currently it's not advancing for monsters not on the same
level. Probably better to expand that to the same dungeon. Esp if we
add more spells.

** Creatures moving

Investigate not waking up creatures until the player sees them / they
see a monser seen by the player. Otherwise groups tend to get broken
up before the player ever sees them.

** Spell is on check

Change to use types rather than objects.

** Special move enhancements

* End of Open Ground

Not marked - harsh on the player

* WallVault backstab

Could trigger without the forward press

* Cannon moves

Killing multiple creatures would be cool

** New spells
* Show items
* Show creatures
** Stamina penalty for dying in combat
* Respawn some monsters on way up to keep it interesting
** Text splurge for items

* Try not to place uniques right near the up stairs?
** What are the point of the items at the bottom of the demon dungeon really? Where can you use them?
* Special enemy instead?

** Balancing

Need more groups in orc - seems a bit dull - as does crypt. Compared
to challenge & forest

Uniques need to be more interesting

Crypt Necros could be tougher, they die very easily (melee)

Crypt skeletal archers could have longer range

Maybe only pull back when closer than minimum range, this lets them
get off more shots before retreating

Terrance and other crypt uniques (daphill) seem too easy (melee build)

Dragon + dungeon was very easy for high-level melee character

Burst of speed is too short duration to be worth doing

Ogres too easy?
 	  

*** FIXED / RESOLVED

** Player and monster effects aren't serialized.
REPORTED: 14/06/10
FIXED: 16/06/10
The base class contains a pointer to the creature or player the effect
affects on. Two options here - store an ID instead or use the fact
that every time we increment the counter on an effect we do so from
the owner, so we can pass this in The latter is probably preferable
since it's less accident prone
