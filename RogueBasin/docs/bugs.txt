*** BUGS PRE 1.5

*** STUFF TO CHECK

** Staircases

Currently we give the player a cheat move when they enter a
dungeon. Prob better to just make staircases take no time
(timeAdvances = false)

** CalculateCreatureFOV
REPORTED: 26/07/10

This is called a lot and not cached. It rarely changes (only when a
creature has moved or similar) and could be very slow.

We have both CalculateCreatureFOV(player) and CalculatePlayerFOV. I
can't see any reason why these are called more than once per turn.

** Stamina can be above health

Really true? Old bug report

** Combat animations
REPORTED: 26/07/10

Seem to draw against a blank background when first entering dungeon?

** Combat animations for special ai creatures
REPORTED: 30/08/10

Do they work? I think so, they are called in the parent class. Check.

** x targetting

Targets sleeping creatures if they are closest, which it probably
shouldn't

** Path finding

GetPathTo() cache starting map. Also in DrawMissileAttack() - that one
never changes so should be very cacheable

** StaircaseEntry

Is this really the best place to have all the enterDungeon stuff?
E.g. sight and stuff. Better in Dungeon?

REPORTED: 26/07/10

Sight has been moved. There are still some movement functions that
could be shared between stairs and some charming checks which could go
into dungeon I guess.

** Marking uniques dead

Saw some stuff in the log file that makes me think this might not
work. Might want to have a UI screen to check easily.

*** ENHANCEMENTS

** Magic effects
REPORTED: 26/07/10

Need to make magic specific versions of the PlayerEffects since
currently 2 effects of the same Type won't stack. This is probably
more in line with the everything a type system than putting a flag in
the class.

Note that we will need to change ApplyEffect() since it current only
uses the worse and best effects. I don't think anything uses this
querk?

-- From older entry on stacking

Do we want effects to stack? Presumably for equipment they need to -
but that's handled differently. Otherwise we will need independent
checks in drinking potions / BurstOfSpeed etc. that they are not
already on. In that case it's possible to allow stacking by making a
slightly different Effect - e.g. SpecialMoveSpeedUp &
PotionSpeedUp. Or put a flag in Effects if they came from a potion, or
special move, speed or monster effect.

** Item is here

Only tell the user is an item is here if they are moving into the
square. Normal moves success is marked with okToMoveIntOSquare - need
a check for specialMove success. This is quite hard, since some moves
have movement in DoMove (e.g. CloseQuarters) as well as the obvious
ones (WallLeap). Could use the return value of DoMove().

** Time advancing for monsters

Currently it's not advancing for monsters not on the same
level. Probably better to expand that to the same dungeon. Esp if we
add more spells.

** Special move enhancements

* End of Open Ground

Not marked - harsh on the player

* WallVault backstab

Could trigger without the forward press

* Cannon moves

Killing multiple creatures would be cool

** New spells
* Show items
* Show creatures
** Stamina penalty for dying in combat
* Respawn some monsters on way up to keep it interesting
** Text splurge for items

* Try not to place uniques right near the up stairs?
** What are the point of the items at the bottom of the demon dungeon really? Where can you use them?
* Special enemy instead?

** Balancing

Need more groups in orc - seems a bit dull - as does crypt. Compared
to challenge & forest

Uniques need to be more interesting

Crypt Necros could be tougher, they die very easily (melee)

Crypt skeletal archers could have longer range

Maybe only pull back when closer than minimum range, this lets them
get off more shots before retreating

Terrance and other crypt uniques (daphill) seem too easy (melee build)

Dragon + dungeon was very easy for high-level melee character

Burst of speed is too short duration to be worth doing

Ogres too easy?

** Respawning
REPORTED: 27/07/10

Want monsters to respawn gradually (probably based on time since last
on level, up to maximum occupancy of normal occupancy). This should
make escaping interesting + the injury penalty

*** FIXED / RESOLVED

** Burst of speed
REPORTED: 14/06/10

Lasts too long and stacks!
Need a current special is on check.

FIXED: 20/06/10

Set to a better duration.  Effects now don't stack so it won't
stack. But it also won't stack with potions.

** Player and monster effects aren't serialized.
REPORTED: 14/06/10
FIXED: 16/06/10
The base class contains a pointer to the creature or player the effect
affects on. Two options here - store an ID instead or use the fact
that every time we increment the counter on an effect we do so from
the owner, so we can pass this in The latter is probably preferable
since it's less accident prone

** Monster SpeedDown effect
REPORTED: 14/06/10
FIXED: 20/06/10
Should use the new effect polling system. Need to check it works

** Spotting monsters
REPORTED: 26/07/10
FIXED: 26/07/10

If we spot a monster and it doens't see us, it will still be
sleeping. It should probably wake up and act randomly.

** Creatures moving
FIXED: 26/07/10

Investigate not waking up creatures until the player sees them / they
see a monser seen by the player. Otherwise groups tend to get broken
up before the player ever sees them.

** Spell is on check
FIXED: 26/07/10

Change to use types rather than objects.

** SightRadiusUp/Down
FIXED: 26/07/10
Should this use the new effect structure? Or is it OK? Not really sure
how it works.

** Pick up lantern / eat berry

Are the sight effects applied immediately (i.e. with the next screen
update)?

REPORTED: 26/07/10 

Berry effects are applied immediately, but
equipping a lantern isn't. It probably affects NormalSightRadius which
isn't accessed until a dungeon staircase.

FIXED: 26/07/10

Both are now applied immediately. Moved sight into CalculateCombatStats()

** Spell check
FIXED: 27/07/10

Need to spell check plot docs - aspell?

** Monster special abilities
REPORTED: 14/07/10
FIXED: 04/08/10

Often don't check for player in FOV (or even range).

Didn't seem to be true and now inherits off throwAndRun anyway.
